# Data Set Details:
The data set that I conducted my analyses on is the [NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Year To Date)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Year-To-Date-/5ucz-vwe8/data_preview). This data set comes from the NYC Open Data website and specifically looks at shootings that occured within the 5 boroughs of NYC. The original data file was in a CSV format. This data set is organized by columns, with names such as: "Date", "Borough", "Longitude", "Latitude", but also names that refere to more specific factors such as: "Perpetrator Race", "Perpetrator Age Group", as well as, "Victim Race" and "Victim Age Group."

The data set itself is very straightforward and easy to read/analyze. While this data set did not need much munging or scrubbing, there were a few columns of data that were not relevant to my analysis, so I made sure to get rid of them. In total, I got rid of 3 columns, the last one and two other columns. Here is the specific code I wrote in order to do so:

    beginning_columns = cleaned_row[:-6]
        edited_columns = cleaned_row[-6:-5] + cleaned_row[-3:-1]
        cleaned_row = beginning_columns + edited_columns
        cleaned_data.append(cleaned_row)
Furthermore, there were a few "(null)" values in my data set and so I decided to replace the "(null") value with "-1" to make my computing easier in Excel when dealing with these values. To do so, I wrote this code:

    cleaned_row = [value if value != "(null)" else "-1" for value in row]

A shortcoming that I faced while doing this assignment was choosing my data set. While this data set was very interesting to look at and analyze, a lot of the data were nominal and not numerical, which made finding the min, max, mode, etc. difficult to do for the specific columns I wanted to look at. Next time, I will find a data set that contains more numerical data that I can work with, in order to draw better, more relevant conclusions.

# Analysis:
Since the majority of my data consists of nominal data, I decided to conduct almost all of my statistics on the "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns of the data set. I found the min, max, average and mode for the latitude and longitude. The min and max functions showed the minimum and maximum longitude and latitude for the recorded shooting incidents. The average function found the mean longitude and latitude for the reported incidents. The most interesting statistic that I calculated for the longitude and latitude was the mode. The mode reveals the longitude and latitude coordinates at which most incidents were recorded. The data was: 40.846117 (Lat) and -73.892569 (Long); after getting this data, I plugged in the coordiantes in ["GPS Coordinates"](https://www.gps-coordinates.net) to find the exact location that recurs the most. This is a location in the Bronx. Furthermore, I calculated the mode for the Precinct number (again, the most recurring precinct recorded) and this number was 46. After Googling [this](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=where+is+precinct+46&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) the location of this Police precinct was found to also be in the Bronx, confirming my previous analysis. From this information, it is evident that most of the recorded shootings had occurred in the Bronx. 

For the second half of the statistics I calculated, I selected a borough (Queens) and used Excel's countif function to count the number of perpetrators in each age group. My findings indicate that the majority (70/167 = ~42%) of the perpetrators were younger than 18. I also used the sum function to find the total number of perpetrators recorded in Queens, which was 167. 
I then used the countif function to find the age group of most of the victims. The calculations revealed that the majority (106/167 = 63.5%) of the victims are between the ages of 25-44. I also created a [chart](data/Chart%201.png) to visualize this data. This finding is very interesting, as I thought that the majority of the perpetrators and victims would be within the same age group. 

I also used the countif function to find the number of shootings recorded in each borough. 
I visualized this data with a [chart](data/Chart%202.png). The highest number of recorded shootings was in the Bronx, which makes sense based on my previously mentioned data (Longitude and Latitude).
